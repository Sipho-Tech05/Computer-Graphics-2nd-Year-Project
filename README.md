# Computer-Graphics-2nd-Year-Project
This is my 2nd year project for Computer Graphics.
This is a simple game built using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT (GLSL included on my JS code)
The name of the game is called the 3D SPACE BALL BOUNCE.
I used an OpenGL variation known as OpenGL ES 2.0 (WebGL).
My choice of this variation comes from the fact that WebGL is browser friendly, it's powered by JavaScript and it's a great starting point for graphics programming for the web.
